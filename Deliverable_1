•Key insights
  •How often would you use this website and for what reasons?
    •Probably use it for all of my classes. I would go to the website to get feedback on my papers so I know I am not making any mistakes such as grammar, structuring, etc. 
  •Are you excited about this website if not why not? If excited what excites you the most about the idea?
    •As a future English teacher, I think it would be a great resource for students to feel less pressure having their papers peer reviewed. Sometimes when we do peer reviewing in class, it can be embarrassing knowing your peers and friends are critiquing you. So, with this I think it would be really great to have the anonymous/stranger feedback from people all over the world.
•Representative quotes
  •“so I know I am not making any mistakes”
  •“it can be embarrassing knowing your peers and friends are critiquing you” 
•Assessment: Must have / Nice to have / Don’t care
  •Features
    •Rating system for reviewer to help get rid of people not helping in the proper way?
      •Must have! It is like the Uber and Lyft rating system. Riders want a good rating from their driver and vice versa. If you, as a reviewer, are putting your effort into others’ work, you want the same back. 
    •Tags to describe what you are posting and what you want to review so you don’t get a paper you don’t want to read or won’t understand?
      •Must have. Personally, I am horrible at anything science or math related. I don’t want to do others a disservice by reviewing their papers if I don’t understand it. On the other hand, if there are tags like these you might find people who can offer more information, feedback or context to your papers.
    •Having to review a person's papers to be able to post your paper for review so that there are not a bunch of papers to review and only few people willing to read them?
      •Nice to have. Sometimes I might be in a hurry to have my paper reviewed, there also might be times that I can’t find a paper that I feel comfortable reviewing.
    •The project as a whole?
      •Nice to have. I think it could be a great resource for high school and college students. With the world moving closer and closer to technology everyday, so is education. I think this is a great opportunity for students, learners and writers alike to share ideas and feedback with one another.
