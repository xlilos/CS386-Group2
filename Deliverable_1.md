## Introduction
A unique website for students/writers where members create a profile and upload their papers to get their work peer reviewed in exchange for 
peer reviewing other members' work. This will build a community that will always be able to constantly have their 
papers reviewed for just the simple and generous task of reading another's work. This is here to solve the problem of having to search or ask 
around for a peer to review your paper. Instead there would be a website you could go to and have people just like you to help you review your paper. 
In return, you can help someone else who is looking for the same thing.

## Interview summary

## Interview 1
•Who was interviewed and who participated in the interview
  •interviewed: Alysa Rippie
  •Participated: Peter Galvan (host)
•When
  •02/05/2021 Noon
•Consumer segment
  •College Student for Education minor in English  
•Key insights
  •How often would you use this website and for what reasons?
    •Probably use it for all of my classes. I would go to the website to get feedback on my papers so I know I am not making any mistakes such as grammar, structuring, etc. 
  •Are you excited about this website if not why not? If excited what excites you the most about the idea?
    •As a future English teacher, I think it would be a great resource for students to feel less pressure having their papers peer reviewed. Sometimes when we do peer reviewing in class, it can be embarrassing knowing your peers and friends are critiquing you. So, with this I think it would be really great to have the anonymous/stranger feedback from people all over the world.
•Representative quotes
  •“so I know I am not making any mistakes”
  •“it can be embarrassing knowing your peers and friends are critiquing you”

    •Rating system for reviewer to help get rid of people not helping in the proper way?
      •Must have! It is like the Uber and Lyft rating system. Riders want a good rating from their driver and vice versa. If you, as a reviewer, are putting your effort into others’ work, you want the same back. 
    •Tags to describe what you are posting and what you want to review so you don’t get a paper you don’t want to read or won’t understand?
      •Must have. Personally, I am horrible at anything science or math related. I don’t want to do others a disservice by reviewing their papers if I don’t understand it. On the other hand, if there are tags like these you might find people who can offer more information, feedback or context to your papers.
    •Having to review a person's papers to be able to post your paper for review so that there are not a bunch of papers to review and only few people willing to read them?
      •Nice to have. Sometimes I might be in a hurry to have my paper reviewed, there also might be times that I can’t find a paper that I feel comfortable reviewing.
    •The project as a whole?
      •Nice to have. I think it could be a great resource for high school and college students. With the world moving closer and closer to technology everyday, so is education. I think this is a great opportunity for students, learners and writers alike to share ideas and feedback with one another.

        • Participated: Nick Nannen (Host)
   • When: Noon, 2/5/2021
   • Consumer segment: Current College students
   • Key insights
      • How often would you use this project and for what reasons?
           • Often if enrolled in an English class. Not very often if not enrolled in an English course.  
             I don’t really write a lot of papers in my major. (Applied Computer Science)
      • Are you excited about this project if not why not? If excited what excites you the most about the idea?
         • Not as excited about this project as I am not as likely to use this website. (see reasoning above)
   • Representative quotes :
      • “I would be likely to use it so long as it doesn’t violate academic integrity.”
      • “I would prefer someone in class over someone on the internet because I would know they would have the proper knowledge to correctly review my paper.”

## Interview 3

•Who was interviewed and who participated in the interview
   •interviewed: Ariella Espinoza
   •Participated: Jonathan White Velasco
•When
   •02/05/2021
•Consumer segment
   •NAU Student: Psychology Major
•Key insights
   •How often would you use this project and for what reasons?
     •Would use frequently for all classes, to catch any mistakes that may have slipped by on the initial draft.
   •Are you excited about this project if not why not? If excited what excites you the most about the idea?
     •Yes. Useful tool for reviewing work. With courses being online instant feedback isn’t as common. Critical in time constraints. The accessibility of being a website is also exciting.
•Representative quotes  
   •“Useful in cases of time constraints.”
   •“More reliable than emailing teachers who may not respond” 

•Assessment: Must have / Nice to have / Don’t care
   •Features
      •Rating system for reviewer to help get rid of people not helping in the proper way?
          •Don’t Care. Not beneficial, the review is objective and may work against people and discourage participants from wanting to review if reviews are bad. 
          •Alternative: Implement an open chat of feedback between you and the reviewer(and vice versa). This allows for constant feedback to better help with questions you or they may have about a review and the ideas behind their review. Additionally, this chat should end based on a due date setup by the review requestor.
      •Tags to describe what you are posting and what you want to review so you don’t get a paper you don’t want to read or won’t understand?
          •Nice to have. The idea is good, but it would be easier to have a system where on account setup you add classes, topics, or tags that you can submit your paper through. This removes the redundancy of using tags every time you write a paper. Some people may leave tags empty or not want to add the same tag if there are papers consistently from the same subject.
      •Having to review a person to be able to post your paper for review so that there are not a bunch of papers to review and only few people willing to read them?
          •Nice to have. Believe this is a good idea. Could be implemented in a match system(like a dating app for essays) in which you are matched with someone that is of the same subject and education level and then you review each other’s papers rather than a system where you earn tokens from reviewing papers that can be used to get your paper reviewed.
      •The project as a whole?
          •A practical idea that would be very useful for college students and high school students mainly but also for anyone in need of peer reviews. This could potentially implement a premium account at one point to generate revenue. Should have education and other important info documented on account setup.

## Interview 4

•Who was interviewed and who participated in the interview
   •interviewed: Zach Merlin
   •Participated:Jonathan White Velasco
•When
   •02/05/2021
•Consumer segment
   •NAU student; English major in Linguistics
•Key insights
   •How often would you use this project and for what reasons?
      •“Being an English major peer reviews are necessary so personally I would use it very often” This includes outside of school for his own personal works and stories.
   •Are you excited about this project if not why not? If excited what excites you the most about the idea?
      •Sounds very interesting and seems unique and very exciting for writers. “There is nothing I’ve seen like this so if this was to be made I would 100% use this.”
•Representative quotes  
      •“Sharing and reviewing papers and stories allows writers to work at the best of their abilities”
•Assessment: Must have / Nice to have / Don’t care
    •Features
       •Rating system for reviewer to help get rid of people not helping in the proper way?
          •Must have plus some: A rating system would be useful but also include comments to allow for feedback.
       •Tags to describe what you are posting and what you want to review so you don’t get a paper you don’t want to read or won’t understand?
          •Must have: The ability to choose what your reviewing allows for a more exciting approach where you aren’t just reviewing academic papers, but more interesting topics.
       •Having to review a person to be able to post your paper for review so that there are not a bunch of papers to review and only few people willing to read them?
          •Must have. This is a great idea to remove the possibility of excess papers that may never be looked at.
       •The project as a whole?
          •Overall, this is a fascinating topic. Haven’t seen anything like this. “It can be hard to get people in close circles to peer review my own work in a way that is beneficial to me so this would definitely be useful.”

    • Having to review a person to be able to post your paper for review so that there are not a bunch of papers to review and only few people willing to read them? 
      • Don’t care, good idea but, a little bit confusing/much for the two part system (long term and short term paper times) 
    • The project as a whole? 
      • Nice to have. Unique concept, cool to review papers from a variety of settings.

• Key insights
  • How often would you use this project and for what reasons?
    • Would use every couple of weeks. Wouldn’t use for super official reviews, just preliminary reviews.
  • Are you excited about this project if not why not? If excited what excites you the most about the idea?
    • From 1-10, about a 3.
    • Crowd-source peer reviewing is the most exciting 
  • Representative quotes  
    • “Having a request system could be detrimental, the point of a peer review is to have a neutral system. Would only be good if a third-party was deciding if a reviewer could review a work.”
    • “The ability to see the credentials of reviewers is a must have.”

   • Consumer segment: Undergraduate Student
   • Key insights
      • How often would you use this project and for what reasons?
         • Somewhat often, I don’t really have a lot of classes that need peer-reviewing at the moment in my major (applied computer science) but I can see the potential.
      • Are you excited about this project if not why not? If excited what excites you the most about the idea?
         • I’m somewhat excited. Having to wait for peer-reviewers in my English class that I took last year was not great. This website could solve that problem.
